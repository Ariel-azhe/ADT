What authorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

The course's lectures.

The course's precepts.

The course's website.

Documents that are referenced directly by the course's website. Such documents include the course's lecture slides and precept handouts.

The course's current staff members outside of class time through office hours.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None.

In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

I used AI to search up syntaxes regarding void pointers, structs, 
dmm, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I think the concept is fun but the debugging is very confusing, which
is realistic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

I disagree with the warning to assert pvValue and pvExtra are not null
because they are just values associated with a key or an extra argument
to a function. They are never dereferenced so they can be NULL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

I disagree with the warning to assert pvValue and pvExtra are not null
because they are just values associated with a key or an extra argument
to a function. They are never dereferenced in my implementation
so they can be NULL. 
I also disagree that I absolutely need to refactor a nested line
because it is nested in 2 if-else statements instead of all loops, 
which doesn't effect efficiency as much. I also have clear comments
reasoning what each layer of loop means.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the CPU times reported by testsymtable.c with binding counts
50, 500, 5000, 50000, and 500000 using (1) your linked list
implementation, (2) your non-expanding hash table implementation, and
(3) your expanding hash table implementation? Fill in the blanks.

The linked list implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.118968 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 19.442574 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed NA (Killed) seconds.

The non-expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.168253 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 37.008152 seconds.

The expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.024311 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 0.415778 seconds.
